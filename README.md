## 💡 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Pip (Python package installer)

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shailtp/E1-gene-prediction-using-Random-Forest-ML-model.git](https://github.com/shailtp/E1-gene-prediction-using-Random-Forest-ML-model.git)
    cd E1-gene-prediction-using-Random-Forest-ML-model
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Running the Model

* **Data Exploration:**
    Open `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` and run the cells to understand the dataset.

* **Model Training:**
    Open `notebooks/02_model_training.ipynb` and run the cells to train the Random Forest model. You might need to adjust parameters based on your specific dataset.

* **Model Evaluation:**
    Open `notebooks/03_model_evaluation.ipynb` and run the cells to evaluate the trained model's performance.

* **Prediction:**
    You can use the trained model within `src/model.py` to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## 📈 Model Performance

The model's performance will be reported in `notebooks/03_model_evaluation.ipynb`. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC will be used to assess the model's effectiveness.
